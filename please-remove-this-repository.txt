Hello Phate212

I did notice that you have the purchased bootstrap theme publicly shared into github for free. 
I guess this didn't happen on purpose.

The original fork that you have was from the repository: https://github.com/pewpewyou/bootstrap-grocery-crud 
(the person that did initially commit the code on github) and he was asked by me - unofficially with an 
email like this - to remove the repository or else there will be a more official abuse report 
with a DMCA takedown notice as the person did also changed the license provided. 
I know people from the community and in fact I knew that this was not done on purpose 
and that's why I did send him just an unofficial email for that.

The person did kindly remove any repository that he had and also some other projects in github 
that included the bootstrap theme (he did have 2 more on github). 

The thing that I've missed however was that not all the forks was removed automatically and 
I didn't know that apparently! 

I couldn't find your email and I did contact github and the only solution that I could find is to send you this pull request.

Please remove this repository from public. In case you need more info please send me an email at: info@grocerycrud.com

Regards
John Skoumbourdis
